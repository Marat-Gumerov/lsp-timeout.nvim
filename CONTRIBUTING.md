# CONTRIBUTING

This project is open-source, meaning you can make as many copies of it as you want and do whatever you want with the code as long as you are not trying to commercialize it, but it does NOT encourage contributions. In order to keep this library in the public domain and ensure that the code does not become contaminated with proprietary or strictly-licensed content or code that is hard to maintain, the project does not accept patches from people who have not submitted an affidavit dedicating their contribution to the author of this project or public domain.

All of the code have been written specifically for use by it; NO code has been copied from unknown sources on the internet unless explicitly specified.

If your contribution is ever accepted, then:
* You waive all your legal rights to any textual or visual contribution you make to this project
* You wholly transfer the said rights to the author of this project
* You admit that the said contribution is subject to change and may be changed beyound recognition
